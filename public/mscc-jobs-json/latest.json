Numbers will be between 8 and 12 each evening. You will be\nin charge of the domestic management of the Chalet communal areas\n,kitchen, dining room and downstairs loo. You would carry out a\nweekly stock take and make a food order each week. You would\nmaintain some simple budget accounts and deal with other\nadministrative tasks as they arise.  As the Host of this Chalet we would expect you to\nbe warm, friendly and caring, and to take a keen interest in the\nwell-being of the rest of the staff team, your teammates, and\nmaintain a good relationship with our landlady and her family who\nalso live in the building. We would therefore expect you take on a\nmanager’s perspective when it comes to the upkeep of the property\nand to remind the team to be respectful of the family, not to be\nnoisy, to maintain high levels of cleanliness in the communal areas\nand in their bedrooms, and to report any damages throughout the\nseason which might occur in the chalet. This would require you to\nfollow and promote our ground rules in the house for all of the\nteam to abide by, especially where cleanliness, tidiness and noise\nlevels are concerned.  Hut-to-Hut changeovers: As cooking\nfor the staff team would take relatively little time each day we\nalso ask the Staff Host to manage the Changeovers of our Hut-to-Hut guests in Corvara. We have five rooms in the building which are dedicated in the chalet to our Hut-to-Hut guests, who typically stay one night with us at the start and end of their trip. You would be responsible for the cleaning of these when they are vacated, and preparing them for our new arrivals,\nwith help from another member of the village team each day. Standby Chalet Chef: If one of the chalet host\nchef couples of the two chalets we run in Corvara were injured or\ntaken ill we would ask you to help in the chalet affected, until\nthey were fit again. At such times we would ask other members of\nthe team to take over your Staff Host cooking duties. This can\nhappen at a moment’s notice and we would need you to be extremely\nflexible on such occasions.  Guest interaction on Organised Walks & in our\nchalets: to fully enjoy this experience we would also want\nyou to spend time with our guests, and it is certainly possible to\nmanage your time to join one or two of our Organised Walks each\nweek with other members of our staff team, as well as socialising\nwith our guests in the chalets. A love of the outdoors and in\nparticular hill walking, climbing or other outdoor activities would\nbe essential to enjoying this experience to the full.",
